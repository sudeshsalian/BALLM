## Install PyTorch
PyTorch is a deep learning framework that is widely used for building and training neural networks. Documentation is available at [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

### Python version
We recommend using **Python 3.12** for this project, as it provides a good balance between stability and modern features.

### Install PyTorch

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment with Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
python3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
